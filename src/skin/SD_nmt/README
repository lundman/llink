			NMT THEME
			=========

This skin uses the images from the standard Popcorn Hour / NMT theme.
Since these images are probably copyrighted you need to get them
from the source:

http://www.popcornhour.com/download/_theme_.zip

Download this file somewhere, say /tmp. Then, extract the zip archive
and copy the sd/ images to the nmt-img/ subdirectory of this theme.
Using UNIX unzip, you can do this with:

	$ unzip -j -d nmt-img /tmp/_theme_.zip '_theme_/sd/*'

Now update llink.conf to use this theme. This theme uses line_lastline.html,
so don't forget to uncomment the TYPE|name=Lastline setting in llink.conf.

You can use the  following keys with this theme:

Home		Go to root of the server
Return		One directory up
Left / PgUp	One page up
Right / PgDown	One page down
Yellow		Play all music files in this directory
Blue		View all image files in this directory

# SSDP is the mulsticast discovery protocol used by the
# Buffalo Networked DVD Player, and hopefully something
# similar by the others. In theory you should
# not need to change anything here if you want to use it.
#
# ON : Required if you want SSDP broadcasting to NMT devices.
#
# UPNP : define to enable UPNP service, MediaServer broadcast.
#      : Alternatively, if you want to use a different UUID
#      : you can use UPNP=<uuid-string>
#
# UPNPPORT=8008
#      : Set this if you wish to change the default UPNP discovery port.
#
# The reverse IP in bindif bug has been fixed.
#
# Example line with all options is:
# SSDP|ON|multicast=239.255.255.250|port=1900|bindif=0|UPNPPORT=8008|
#         UPNP=uuid:E25641A0-8228-11DE-AFB8-0002A5D5C51B
#
# The default is:
#SSDP|ON
SSDP|ON|UPNP|UPNPPORT=8008

#
# When we receive SSDP broadcast, and there might be a lot
# on your network, select the "match" filter by which we
# will recognise our DVD Player. In theory this should work
# for all MyiBox devices. If your report something different
# please email me for updates.
#
# Example line with all options is:
# USN|match=*myiBoxUPnP*SyabasSTB*|pattern=192.168.*:*
#
# The default is:
USN|match=*myiBoxUPnP*SyabasSTB*|pattern=*
#USN|match=*


# Advanced:
# Manually connect and declare ourselves? This should not be needed but
# for some situations it could be useful.
# For llink running on nmt, it ignores SSDP from own IP, so we alias a new
# IP, and force announcement to port 2020.

#
# The HTTP request port. This is where the DVD player will connect
# for the directory listings, as well as the files.
# By default, Buffalo's own software uses port 8000, so I use
# port 8001 so that both can run at the same time.
# The "name" field is what is displayed on the DVDPlayer.
# "pin" is only used for "parental" extra authority. All Directories and
# files starting with a "." are normally not shown. If a PIN is entered
# correctly, these are added to the listing. They are actually text strings.
# "buffersize" lets you modify the size of binary transfers. So far not been
# required except for when communicating with iPod/iPad.
#
# NOTE: user and pass is NOT yet implemented! Use bindif to
# bind to internal only nic. Patterns are also to come. See bindif note above
#
# Example line with all options is:
#HTTP|port=8001|bindif=0|pin=1234|name=llink-daemon|user=Syabasi|pass=myIBox|BUFFER=16384
#
# The default is:
HTTP|port=8001|pin=1234|name=llink-daemon

#
# AUTH|pattern
#
# If the PIN= argument is used with HTTP command, you can specify IP patterns
# who will always behave as if a valid PIN had been entered.
#
# pattern is matched with IP address only (not hostname) and uses fnmatch syntax
# (like Unix shell). Patterns line "192.168.11.10[123]" would match 101,102,103.

# The SKIN used for all directory listings. Not that there are many.
# It will send "head.html", followed by the "TYPE" files below, and
# finally "tail.html". If you do something neat, please send it to me.
#
# SIZE_TYPE=human|bytes|none
#
# When replacing LLINK_FILE_SIZE, should it use human (5GB, 350MB) or
# bytes (1234576) or none (space). Note if you want to have details in
# the skin, use LLINK_DETAIL_SIZE which is always "bytes".
#
# PAGE_SIZE sets the number of lines a listing should send, by default.
# You can not set it if you want everything in one long list. Note that
# clients can always request from/to, which over-rides this value.
#
# PASSES specifies how many times should it loop over a directory listing,
# usually 1 is sufficient, but if you are doing fancy things... it tags on
# PASS number infront of the file names. Ie, head.html->2head.html,
# line_dir.html->2line_dir.html. First pass is still head.html. (not 1head.html).

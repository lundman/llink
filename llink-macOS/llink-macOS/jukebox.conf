# SSDP is the mulsticast discovery protocol used by the
# Buffalo Networked DVD Player, and hopefully something
# similar by the others. In theory you should
# not need to change anything here if you want to use it.
#
# Example line with all options is:
# SSDP|ON|multicast=239.255.255.250|port=1900|bindif=0
#
# The default is:
SSDP|ON



# 
# When we receive SSDP broadcast, and there might be a lot
# on your network, select the "match" filter by which we
# will recognise our DVD Player. In theory this should work
# for all MyiBox devices. If your report something different
# please email me for updates.
#
# Example line with all options is:
# USN|match=*myiBoxUPnP*SyabasSTB*|pattern=192.168.*:*
#
# The default is:
USN|match=*myiBoxUPnP*SyabasSTB*|pattern=*




#
# The HTTP request port. This is where the DVD player will connect
# for the directory listings, as well as the files.
# By default, Buffalo's own software uses port 8000, so I use 
# port 8001 so that both can run at the same time.
# The "name" field is what is displayed on the DVDPlayer.
#
# NOTE: user and pass is NOT yet implemented! Use bindif to
# bind to internal only nic. Patterns are also to come.
#
# Example line with all options is:
#HTTP|port=8001|bindif=0|name=llink-daemon|user=Syabasi|pass=myIBox
#
# The default is:
HTTP|port=8002

#
# The SKIN used for all directory listings. Not that there are many.
# It will send "head.html", followed by the "TYPE" files below, and
# finally "tail.html". If you do something neat, please send it to me.
#
# SIZE_TYPE=human|bytes|none
#
# When replacing LLINK_FILE_SIZE, should it use human (5GB, 350MB) or
# bytes (1234576) or none (space). Note if you want to have details in
# the skin, use LLINK_DETAIL_SIZE which is always "bytes".
#
# PAGE_SIZE sets the number of lines a listing should send, by default.
# You can not set it if you want everything in one long list. Note that
# clients can always request from/to, which over-rides this value.
#
# PASSES specifies how many times should it loop over a directory listing, 
# usually 1 is sufficient, but if you are doing fancy things... it tags on
# PASS number infront of the file names. Ie, head.html->2head.html, 
# line_dir.html->2line_dir.html. First pass is still head.html. (not 1head.html).
#
# Example line with all options is:
# SKIN|path=./skin/default/|MaxNameLength=40
# 
#
SKIN|path=./skin/jukebox/|PAGE_SIZE=10|SIZE_TYPE=human|PASSES=2

#
# Define types of movies. This is to match a filename, to a
# HTML template file. So that "*.mpg" files, use "lines_movies.html"
# when producing HTML for the DVD Player.
# NOTE: This is "in ORDER". The first/top match here is used. End this
# list with "ext=*" and "name=unknown", or, blank if you wish not
# to display unknown types.
#
# See also the "mime.types" file, although my DVDPlayer seems to ignore
# "Content-Type:" tag.
#
# Example line with all options is:
# TYPE|name=Movies|ext=*.mpg/*.mpeg/*.avi/*.wmv|filename=line_movie.html
#

# Separators. If you require extra HTML every 5th directory listing, as
# and example, we do this with special TYPE entry. This need to be before any
# File extention mappings. Note it is sent before item "X" so if you want 5
# entries, then a separator, the value to use is "6".
TYPE|name=Separator|ext=NA|count=6|ignore=*|filename=separator.html

# Movie types
TYPE|name=Movies|ext=*.mpg/*.mpeg/*.avi/*.wmv/*.mp4/*.vob/*.ifo/*.ts/*.flv/*.iso/*.mkv/*.tp/*.mov/*.m2ts/*.evo|filename=line_movie.html

# Music types
TYPE|name=Music|ext=*.mp3/*.wav/*.ogg/*.wma|filename=line_music.html

# Default entry for directory
TYPE|name=Directory|ext=NA|filename=line_dir.html

# Unrar on the fly? Match *.rar, but ignore anything not .part01.rar
#
# Windows path, but you probably want the special unrar-seek
#TYPE|name=RarDirectory|ext=*.rar|ignore=*.part00[23456789].rar/*.part[123456789][123456789]?.rar|filename=line_dir.html|cmd=unrar|args=c:/Program%20Files/WinRAR/UnRAR.exe

# Re-direct. You can also send certain file lookups to check an alternate

# "filename" needs just be defined, it is otherwise not used. "args" should

# iMDb filtering of names
# These patterns are fnmatch, so wildcards can be used, but the name is
# already split into words split by space/-/_/.

# Your root device(s). I allow you to specify the root as you want it
# and as many roots as you would like. You can also specify flags to
# be passed to libdirlist for sorting rules etc.
#
# NOTE: If you define mutiple roots, and those top level directories
# have the same named file and/or directory, you will only be able to
# access the first defined one. Please rename the clashes, or, put them 
# into a sub-directory. (Or don't use multiple roots)
#
# Also note that if you ask for a certain sorting style, it will not
# quite work right in the root, since each root is listed, and sorted,
# independently.
#
# The list flags are:
#
#  -t  Sort list in date order
#  -N  Sort list in name order
#  -r  Reverse sorting order
#  -D  Sort directories before files. (Like Windows)
#  -s  Sort list in size order
#  -I  Case insensitive sorting. (Like Windows)
#  -a  Show dot-files
#  -W  Show directory content size instead of block count (expensive)
#  -G  If found ".genre" file, display this instead of group field.
